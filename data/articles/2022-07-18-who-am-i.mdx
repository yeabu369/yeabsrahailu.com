## About me

I am Yeabsra Hailu. I think you already got that from site when you first arrived but hey gotta mention it again for the article's sake.

I graduated from [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University](http://www.aastu.edu.et/) on July 12, 2022. I am currently attending
my Master's in Computer Science at Maharishi International University.

I am a Computer Engineer with 5+ years of experience from Hardware to Software development. I am skilled in multiple programming languages. I have worked in areas of robotics, web development, AI and Blockchain.

On the other side, I am a serial Arbitrageur and Investor. I have 6+ years of experience in the Crypto market with good insight in trading, investing and market arbitrage.

I have worked on a few startups I founded and co-founded. I built one solution that provides US Banking for Africans. And the other one is I built a local marketplace that allows people to exchange crypto via ETB.

Anyways, I like designing, building and hacking projects to ease the boredom.

_Yeah, let's end it here for now. Will add more to this. Who am I is a hard question to answer instantly, you know._
