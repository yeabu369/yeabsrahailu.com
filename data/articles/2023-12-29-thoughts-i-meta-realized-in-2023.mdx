In 2023, I came to several meta-realizations that have significantly shaped my perspective on life, work, and technology.

**Life is deeply mechanical and robotic.** We are, in essence, ‘keyword puppets,’ reacting to stimuli in predictable ways. This realization does not diminish our humanity but rather underscores the importance of understanding our triggers and responses.

**Software Engineering (SWE) is rough but gives you deeply structured thinking.** It’s not about whether to go horizontal or vertical; at this point, it’s just about execution. Text, in this context, becomes the ultimate form of arbitrage. It’s all about alignment, and it’s obvious from the words you type.

**Workflows can definitely be optimized.** With the advent of AI, it’s now pure execution. AI has essentially ‘eaten’ my workflow, streamlining processes and increasing efficiency.

**America is a different beast,** with its unique challenges and opportunities. It’s a place where multitasking is essential, but with better context switching and smooth transitions.

**Applying caching in my workflow** was a game-changer. It’s a simple concept, much like the client-server model, which is the simplest and yet the most sophisticated architecture.

**The social graph is now the focus.** Each person is as vivid as a node. It’s either a peer, a client, or a server. Applying software architecture in my lifestyle has helped me realize different patterns.

**Don’t internalize patterns and system designs unless forced or required to.** Most systems require flexibility and loose coupling in their design. Delegate every possible workflow to your computer to speed up execution.

**Taking pictures gives you super memory.** It’s a way to capture moments and information, enhancing recall. I’ve also become more aware of the keywords people mention when they speak to pick up their bias. It’s important to validate and verify this bias.

**Boolean logic still wins.** If I tell you `x` and `y`, it’s a conjunction. If I tell you x or y, it’s a disjunction. What humans call thinking is what computers call processing. We need to delegate more thinking to computers and focus on the absolute most essential part of the execution, which is the doing part.

**Gathering resources is simply copying and pasting.** The best architectures make the data logistics of copying and pasting seamless. High frequency matters for a product or service. It helps identify single points of failure and later scale accordingly.

**Learning is the process of essentially copying a highly dense information from a least accessible node to a highly accessible node.** This insight underscores the importance of accessibility and efficiency in the learning process. It’s about making the most of the resources available to us and optimizing our methods of information retrieval.

**Lagging information keeps winning.** It’s better to schedule than deal with real-time effects as memory is costly. This realization highlights the importance of planning and scheduling in managing information. Real-time processing can be resource-intensive, and sometimes, it’s more efficient to deal with lagging information.

In conclusion, 2023 was a year of profound realizations and growth. As I move forward, these insights will continue to shape my approach to life, work, and technology.
