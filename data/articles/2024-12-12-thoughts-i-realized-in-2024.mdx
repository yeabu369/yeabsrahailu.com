In 2024, I came to several realizations that have significantly shaped my perspective on life, work, and technology.

    - This year signaled the start and mark of my career as a SWE in the united states.
    - I never thought I would end up on this journey simply because it felt distant in the past.
    - It was also a new experience and refresh working in corporate America.
    - I moved to a different city.
    - My imposter syndrome slowly faded after I discovered all the gatekeeping was for nothing afterall.
    - I felt my brain fog lift up as that SWE money started hitting.
    	- I remember a friend saying you're not ready for when the money starts hitting you.
    - I can think properly now. I was numb initally when I started the year from all effort and burnout I spent on cracking the tech market in the states.
    - It turns out you don't need to know everything in tech in the U.S., you just need to know Angular and Java.
    - I transitioned from working almost all my career from React to Angular. The shift wasn't that hard as I thought. It turns out angular is nicer and more corpo fit. I am working with templates again. Angular just felt like a templating engine. But still was nice enough as a component based framework. The two way binding was odd.
    - I didn't mentor any juniors yet as a senior SWE. However, I felt like I needed to recover as well from all the find and search.
    - Oh did I mention I moved to a different city. I was based in Texas for a month. Texas was great. I attended a few conferences.
    - I realized I made a lot of mistakes when searching for a job. It's about networking but I went blunt, direct and in fact irreverent at times.
    - I attended more meeting forever in my lifetime than I have coded. My past experience was mostly working in startups. I wore many hats and worked in a fast paced enviroment.
    - Now, I am in the largest ship, enterprise. Did I ship? Not on my own but I did eventually.

    - Biases prevail over weights. I am amazed at how acute biases change your workflow.
    - I started the year with a regular player character vibes, I am possibly ending and leading into the year after with main character vibes.
    - The theme of next year is going to be branding, developing further genuine connection and continued search.

    - oh lol, btw culture. I was so itchy about why I was supposed to ask that on interviews. I was amazed now why I didn't probe further and grilled my interviewers like they grilled me.
    - lying creates fate inconsistencies, however, the search space is orthogonal, you can always course correct if you're a good engineer.
    - don't mix profile and identity, you're just an engineer and who you're on a given platform shan't eat you up alive.
    - i can speak my mind eventually.
    - i broke up with ai. I *rawdogged* most of my tasks and stories during my current work year. I really hated the fact that I delegated my thoughts and being to AI. i felt robbed.
    - i can now think independently, ai was just a tool I leveraged during my desperate hours.
    - i realized just by how much I was leading despite the fact that I felt behind a lot
    - i now really know what it means to lead.
    - experience translates to computer hours not the usual work hours you're used to.

    - the lighter your tech task the faster you can get by your day, but the less features you would get
    - hateoas fudging makes sense lol, i really didn't get it until i went almost crazy (schizo) with my computer.
    - just 16" macbook pro will do its magic, no monitors really needed
    - arc browser really locked me in as one of those products
    - i realized i suffer a lot from apophenia where I tend to notice more numbers than others 3, 6, 9, 8 0 8, 9 11 and a few others i don't really remember.
    - i loosened my creepy recordings
    - i made good money in crypto but eventually got stuck with some issue i can't discuss here
    - the x timeline is such a trap
    - i will be graduating my master's in computer science, crazy pivot from computer engineering
    	- i know i messed up with the master's thing, it really hurt me in my personal tech exploration, also degraded my mental health a bit
    	- however it boosted my profile when it came to finding a job
    	- might not have found a job if i was just using a my bachelors
    - i really can lead

    - monospace has always been the goat

    optional
    - i stopped gooning around and self-sabotaging could this be actual brain development?
    - meditation really helps tune out your frequency, it's essentially resting state.
    - my performance gains from attention to detail didn't really have huge margins this year, though it has improved dramatically compared to the past years
    - i have been away from my parents for 2 years 1 month 2 weeks 4 days 20 hours 46 min 39 s
    - it's just crazy how it can be.
    - i have the money but i am not spending it because i am love investing (probabilitstic gambling with temporal and spatial arbitrage üíÄü´µüèª)
    - i realized i really crossed my internal mental wires when trying to obsess and control things so they would be in my favor.
    - the arrow of time is real lol

    - i just realized further this year that i love my content centered, aligned and whitespaced
    - money has pure SNR (signal-to-noise) ratio, currency has poor SNR
    - 36 T in debts lol
    - i created my first C-Corp 8T Capital
    - i realized i can just do things now.
    - asking or looking for pity really doesn't work
    - in a corporate setting at least conformity is sought after, at least in the learning, getting to know stuff phase
    - i don't know, it's as simple as that
    - i believe
    - i realized my ultimate principles
    	- i really pushed myself far enough to understand what my values and culture is.
    	- i really strive for these principles
    		- energy
    		- longevity
    		- company
    		- compute

    - soft skills lol
    	- it helps tho
    - i really understand consistency better now.
    - i also figured i am quite easygoing when it comes to social activities.
    - tech is still king. i can always rely on tech.
    - sounds creepy but the theme leading into the year was record everything.
    - software = product + batch processing : at least in my current view
    - my brain is about to explode from hearing the word process being tossed around the workplace
    - my computer engineering background really gives me a granular look though i work on UIs mostly lol
    - back to square one, love at first sight with Java lol
    - the keyword game almost depleted my memory
    - i forked hard with the year
    - i am having fun with this alamnac


    - i am being forced to own a car hahahah
    - i still don't have a car
    - maybe next year
    - New York is amazing. it's surreal to be there
    - pay your debts but not too much at once

    after my birthday
    - the vibes shifted significantly, i have a morning routine now lol
    - i showered 95% of the time cold
    - needed those 5% to compensate for the winter arc
    - security is funny

    - i figured i take notes lol
    - don't find yourself in someone else's note lol
    - i started verbatim, to verbose then eventually back to fuzziness.

    - i had all the knowledge and didn't have the capital
    	- this year i finally have the capital
    		- it's really rare for capital & knowledge to come in one pot (mind)
    		- you're usually blessed with one or the other

    - i have a mustache, eventually
    - vulnerability is a phase lol?
    - i got requests from old friends and japanese online friends to outsource jobs to them.
    - the algo works magic by the way
    	- the way the algo pulls mutuals is just crazy
    	- the algo rewards consistency but it's definition is eventual for humans
    	- strong consistency depletes memory, both personal and machine memory
    - i am getting good on these one-liners
    - direction vs indirection, it takes time be the master of abstratction
    - i realized the web is ultimately where i will be and it's my eventual execution stack
    - funny how i chose javascript initially because i thought i would also be building desktop apps with it
    - oauth is still my weakness but i am not scared of it anymore lol üòÜ
    - zero to one is doable except it's an infinite spike in energy which is not what we're used to as human beings, lot of controls, plugs, configs to balance out such a spike
    - i bookmarked a lot of math, physics and engineering contents. when will i get to them, we'll never know.
    - i never saw the timeline on socials as a an execution stack or layer

    - i attended my first biggest open source conference. it was crazy to see all the tech stack that i have virutally been working with all my life are actually made by real hooman beings.
